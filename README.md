# WME EZ Comments

**WME EZ Comments** is a lightweight userscript for the **Waze Map Editor (WME)** designed to help volunteer editors communicate with drivers more efficiently.

Instead of typing the same "Where was the missing turn?" or "Is this road open?" messages over and over, **WME EZ Comments** allows you to drop pre-formatted, professional responses into Update Requests (URs) with a single click.

**Built with the official [Waze Map Editor JavaScript SDK](https://www.waze.com/editor/sdk/)**

## Why use WME EZ Comments?

* **Save Time**: No more repetitive typing or copy-pasting from a Notepad file.
* **Consistency**: Keep your communication professional and aligned with community standards.
* **Human Touch**: Pre-load templates that sound like a real person, not a support bot.
* **Focus on Editing**: Spend less time writing and more time fixing the map.

## Key Features
* **One-Click Responses**: Quickly reply to common reports like General Error, Incorrect Turn, or Missing Road.
* **Customizable Templates**: Easily edit the text to match your local community's tone and guidelines.
* **Smart Reminders**: Send follow-up "nudges" to users who haven't responded to your initial inquiry.
* **Auto-Closing**: Ready-made templates for closing resolved issues or marking reports as "Not Identified."

## Installation

1. Install a Userscript Manager: You'll need [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari).
2. Install the Script:
   * Install [WME EZ Comments](user.js) (Note: Ensure the path to the .js file is correct)
3. Refresh WME: Open the Waze Map Editor and you should see the WME EZ Comments panel/options when viewing an Update Request.

## How it Works
When you open an Update Request (UR) in WME, EZComments adds a series of buttons or a dropdown menu to the UR panel. Simply select the comment that fits the situation, and the script will automatically populate the comment box for you.
